## 📂 Projects

| Project | Description | Tools Used | Link |
|--------|-------------|------------|------|
| 🌱 **DigiCow Farmer Adoption Prediction** | Built a multi-target probabilistic classification model to predict farmer adoption within 7, 90, and 120 days after training. Optimized for Log Loss (75%) and ROC-AUC (25%). Achieved **0.93** vs top score of **0.97**. | Python, pandas, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost | [DigiCow Repo](https://github.com/Mulinga/DigiCow-Farmer-Adoption-Prediction) |
| 💳 **Financial Health Prediction** | Developed a machine learning model to predict customer financial health status using behavioral and transactional features. Focused on feature engineering, imbalance handling, and probability calibration for risk scoring. | Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib | [Financial Health Prediction Repo](https://github.com/Mulinga/Financial-Health-Prediction) |
| 🚦 **Barbados Traffic Analysis Challenge** | End-to-end traffic prediction and root cause analysis using CatBoost on large-scale traffic camera data. | Python, pandas, CatBoost, scikit-learn | [Repo](https://github.com/Mulinga/Barbados-Traffic-Analysis) |
